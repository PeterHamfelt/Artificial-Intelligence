## Introduction





### + Contrastive Learning

the hidden representations of two augmented views of the same object (positive pairs) are brought closer together, while those of different objects (negative pairs) are encouraged to be further apart.

Minimizing differences between positive pairs encourages modeling invariances, while contrasting negative pairs is thought to be required to prevent representational collapse (i.e., mapping all data to the same representation).
