A collection of resources on Neural Implicit Surfaces.

## Introduction

This line of research focuses on representing the sceneâ€™s geometry implicitly using a neural network, making the surface rendering process differentiable. 



The main drawback of these methods is their requirement of **masks that separate objects from the background.** require foreground mask as supervision

struggle with severe self-occlusion or thin structures

Learning to render surfaces directly tends to grow extraneous parts due to optimization problems.



non-Lambertian surfaces and thin structures



These methods can be divided into two categories:

- ...





- SDF or occupancy

  

### Problem Definition

a set of posed images $\{\mathcal{I}_k\}$ of a 3D object, goal is to reconstruct the surface $\mathcal{S}$ of the object.
