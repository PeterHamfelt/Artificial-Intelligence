A collection of resources on Neural Implicit Surfaces.

## Introduction

This line of research focuses on representing the sceneâ€™s geometry implicitly using a neural network, making the surface rendering process differentiable. 



The main drawback of these methods is their requirement of masks that separate objects from the background.

Learning to render surfaces directly tends to grow extraneous parts due to optimization problems.



These methods can be divided into two categories:

- ...
