 the data transformations are defined using linear paths in a Euclidean latent space



先描述问题，再找解决办法



Learning transport operators for image manifolds



> we desire a manifold model that allows us to learn the data structure, generate points outside of the training set, and map out smooth manifold paths through the latent space.





Decoder或者Generator这样的是从一个低维到高维的映射，如果这个分布不能匹配源数据的分布，生成的效果就会很差。

learning mappings from low-dimensional latent vectors to high dimensional data while 



According to the manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data can often be modeled as lying on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold
