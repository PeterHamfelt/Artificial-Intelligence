<h1 align="center">Evolutionary optimization (EO)</h1>
<div align="center">
    Evolutionary optimization (EO) algorithms use a population based approach in which more than one solution participates in an iteration and evolves a new population of solutions in each iteration. It's mainly used to solve multi-objective optimization problems.

## The advantages of EO:

(i) EOs do not require any derivative information

(ii) EOs are relatively simple to implement

(iii) EOs are flexible and have a wide-spread applicability
